# Morse Code Translator

## Morse to English & English to Morse Translator(s)

Two Java Projects:
- MorseCode: Main code using Scanner/CLI to implement a grab-and-compile system. Just input either Morse OR English and it will translate the one inputted
- MorseCodeFrame: Secondary code implementing a JFrame system to give it a better UI display and lose the Scanner/CLI aspect to the code to do the same idea. Just input either Morse OR English and it will translate and export the one inputted


### Reason/Implementation

This is very simple and elementary code, but I did want to relearn a bit of Java in the process. I have not coded in Java much, at all, since I was a teenager and this was a good challenge to relearn some of my past expertise!
